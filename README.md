Insight DevOps project

I am not the original author of then files inside of the "docker" and "k8s_dashboard" directories. I merely edited them to suit the needs of this project. All other files were written by me from scratch. 


## Project Summary:

Whether it's due to costs or regulations, not everyone can run in the cloud, but that doesn’t mean you can’t be just as agile as those who do. There are 2 main issues with managing on-premise servers. 1). Reliability suffers due to server failures. 2) New features are held back due to the long purchase/install cycle for new servers.

We need to stop babysitting individual servers, and begin to think in terms of total cores and memory. My command line tool enables a team to request their resources in these terms, and all the heavy lifting is handled for them. Within minutes, they will have a Kubernetes cluster to deploy their services on, which they can also resize as needed.
